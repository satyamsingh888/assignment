1.  inline elemnet--
    
     Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, 
     instead of breaking the flow of the content. Note: An inline element does not start on a new 
     line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
     
     <a>
    <abbr>
    <acronym>
    <b>
    <bdo>
    <big>
    <br>
    <button>
        these are some inline elements.
   
   block type element--
   
   A block-level element always starts on a new line, 
   and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
   A block-level element always takes up the full width available 
   (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

     <dt>
    <fieldset>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <form>
    <h1>-<h6>
    <header>
    <hr>
    <li>
     <main>
     <nav>
     <noscript>
    <ol>
    <p>
     
    these are some example of block level element.


2.  The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page. 
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; 
images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image. 
The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.    
    

3.  There are three types of list
    a. Unorderd list
    <ul>
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
      </ul> 
    b. Orderd list
    <ol>
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
      </ol> 
    c. Description list
    <dl>
        <dt>Coffee</dt>
        <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
        <dt>Milk</dt>
        <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
      </dl> 
      
4.  Use the <a> element to define a link.
    Use the href attribute to define the link address.
    Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document.
    Use the <img> element (inside <a> ) to use an image as a link.     
<a href="http://amazone.com">go to amazone</a>
