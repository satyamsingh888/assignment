    HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

    a.All HTML elements can have attributes
    b.Attributes provide additional information about elements
    c.Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    d.Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

They may not be necessary for some elements, especially the closing tags. Equally important, the attributes are only within the opening tags....
